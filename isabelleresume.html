    <h2>Summary</h2>
    Since the moment I could hold a pencil and write, I've been telling stories. I've always loved going to new worlds while I read, and I wanted to be that person who created those new worlds. With two serious novels in the works ("After Morigan's Body Died" and "The Tapestry"), I apire to be a full time author. To reach my goal, I need experience in the writing world and would love to do freelance work for you. I may just be a beginner writer, but with your help, I can make my way up the ranks, and give you the work you deserve.
